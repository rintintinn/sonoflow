# Voiding Time Detection Algorithm

This document describes the evolution of the voiding time detection algorithm and the different approaches tested.

## Problem Statement

The original algorithm used the **entire recording duration** as voiding time. This was incorrect because:
1. Pre-void silence (0-10+ seconds of background noise before actual urination)
2. Post-void noise (sounds after urination ends, e.g., toilet flushing, movement)

**Goal**: Detect the actual voiding segment and shift the time axis to start at t=0.

## Validation Data

| Recording | Medical-Grade Voiding Time | Original Detection |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| `2026_02_07_12_43_34_1.wav` | **24.7 seconds** | 41.4 seconds |

---

## Approaches Tested

### Approach 1: Simple Threshold (1.5× Noise Floor) ❌
```python
threshold = noise_floor * 1.5
above = energy > threshold
start = first above threshold
end = last above threshold
```
**Result**: Captured too much - background noise triggered threshold early.

---

### Approach 2: Higher Threshold (2.0× Noise Floor) ❌
```python
threshold = noise_floor * 2.0
```
**Result**: Still triggered at t=0.6s due to low background noise variability.

**Diagnostic data**:
- 2.0×: first=0.6s, last=41.3s, span=40.8s ❌

---

### Approach 3: Even Higher Threshold (3.0× Noise Floor) ⚠️
```python
threshold = noise_floor * 3.0
```
**Result**: Start detection correct at t=11.2s, but span still 29s (expected 24.7s).

**Diagnostic data**:
- 3.0×: first=11.2s, last=40.3s, span=29.1s

**Issue**: Post-void spike at t=38-40s (7× noise) was being included.

---

### Approach 4: Gap-Based Segment Detection ❌
Detect contiguous segments above threshold, separated by gaps >2 seconds.
```python
MIN_GAP_FRAMES = 80  # ~2 seconds
# Find segments separated by gaps
# Pick segment with highest peak energy
```
**Result**: 30.0s - gap between t=35s and t=40s was only ~2-3s with scattered frames.

---

### Approach 5: Sustained Low Energy End Detection ❌
Find end as last frame followed by >1 second of sustained low energy (<2× noise).
```python
SUSTAINED_LOW_FRAMES = 40  # 1 second
low_threshold = noise_floor * 2.0
# Find frames followed by sustained silence
```
**Result**: 30.0s - t=38s rises back to 2.1× noise, breaking the silence detection.

**Diagnostic data** (energy ratio at different times):
```
t=35s: 0.9× (low - flow ended)
t=36s: 1.2× (low)
t=37s: 1.0× (low)
t=38s: 2.1× (rises above 2× threshold!)
t=39s: 3.0× (post-void spike)
t=40s: 7.0× (post-void spike)
```

---

### Approach 6: Peak-Relative End Detection ✅ **LEGACY**
Find end as first point after peak where energy drops to <10% of peak and stays low for 0.5s.
```python
peak_energy = np.max(energy)
end_threshold = peak_energy * 0.10  # 10% of peak
SUSTAINED_LOW_FRAMES = 20  # 0.5 seconds

for i in range(peak_idx, len(energy)):
    if energy[i] < end_threshold:
        # Check if stays low for 0.5s
        if stays_low_for(i, SUSTAINED_LOW_FRAMES):
            true_end_idx = i
            break
```

**Result**: **23.7s** (expected 24.7s) - **96% accuracy** ✅

**Why it works**:
- Uses relative threshold (10% of peak) instead of absolute noise floor
- Peak at t=31.5s is very high (~30× noise)
- 10% of peak ≈ 3× noise floor
- At t=35s, energy drops to 0.9× noise, which is well below 10% of peak
- Post-void spike at t=40s (~7× noise) is still below 10% of peak (~3× noise threshold)

---

### Approach 7: Otsu + Changepoint ✅ **LEGACY**

Adaptive thresholding combined with rolling-statistics changepoint detection.

```python
# Step 1: Otsu's method for adaptive threshold
threshold = otsu_threshold(energy)  # Data-driven, no fixed constants

# Step 2: Rolling statistics changepoint detection
short_mean = rolling_mean(energy, window=5)
long_mean = rolling_mean(energy, window=20)
ratio = short_mean / long_mean

# Step 3: Find onset (ratio > 1.5 sustained for ≥8 frames)
onset_idx = first sustained rise above ratio threshold

# Step 4: Find end (ratio < 0.7 sustained for ≥8 frames)
end_idx = last sustained period above ratio threshold
```

**Result**: **23.2s** (expected 24.7s) - **94% accuracy** ✅

**Limitation**: Stops at first sustained silence, missing subsequent flow episodes in intermittent voiding.

---

### Approach 8: Multi-Episode Detection ✅ **CURRENT DEFAULT**

Handles intermittent voiding patterns (straining, BPH) by detecting ALL episodes first, then merging.

```python
from multi_episode_detection import detect_voiding_multiepisode

multi_result = detect_voiding_multiepisode(
    energy=energy,
    time_axis=time_axis,
    noise_floor=noise_floor,
)

# Gap classification determines which episodes to include:
# Gap < 2s  → straining pause → include
# Gap > 5s  → post-void activity → exclude  
# Gap 2-5s  → include if next episode ≥20% of peak energy

start_idx = multi_result.voiding_start_idx
end_idx = multi_result.voiding_end_idx
voiding_time = multi_result.voiding_time    # Includes pauses
flow_time = multi_result.flow_time          # Excludes pauses
num_episodes = multi_result.num_episodes
flow_pattern = multi_result.pattern         # "continuous", "intermittent", "straining"
```

**Result**: **23.7s** voiding time, **23.4s** flow time, 2 episodes detected

**Why this is now default**:
- **Handles intermittent voiding** — doesn't miss episodes after pauses
- **ICS-compliant dual timing** — separate voiding_time and flow_time
- **Flow pattern classification** — diagnostically valuable for BPH patients
- **Gap-based logic** — clinically meaningful thresholds (2s/5s/20%)

## Current Default vs Legacy

| Method | Detection | Flow Pattern | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Multi-Episode** | 23.7s voiding / 23.4s flow | Intermittent (2 ep) | **Default** |
| Otsu+Changepoint | 23.2s | N/A | Legacy |
| Peak-Relative Fixed | 23.7s | N/A | Legacy |
| Medical-Grade Reference | 24.7s | - | Ground truth |

## ICS-Compliant Timing

The International Continence Society defines two distinct timing metrics:

| Metric | Definition | Use |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Voiding Time** | First flow to last flow, INCLUDING pauses | Total event duration |
| **Flow Time** | Actual flow only, EXCLUDING pauses | Qavg calculation |

```python
# ICS-compliant Qavg
qavg = volume_ml / flow_time   # NOT voiding_time
```

---

## Final Algorithm Summary (Current Default)

```python
from multi_episode_detection import detect_voiding_multiepisode

# Multi-episode detection handles everything:
result = detect_voiding_multiepisode(energy, time_axis, noise_floor)

start_idx = result.voiding_start_idx
end_idx = result.voiding_end_idx
voiding_time = result.voiding_time    # ICS voiding time (with pauses)
flow_time = result.flow_time          # ICS flow time (without pauses)
num_episodes = result.num_episodes
flow_pattern = result.pattern

# Time shift
time_axis = time_axis[start_idx:end_idx] - time_axis[start_idx]
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Absolute thresholds fail** when background noise varies between recordings
2. **Peak-relative thresholds** are more robust across different recording environments
3. **Sustained silence detection** needs to use a threshold below any post-void activity
4. **Gap detection** fails when post-void sounds are close in time to voiding end
5. **The 10% of peak threshold** works because post-void sounds are typically much weaker than peak urine flow
6. **Otsu's method** provides truly adaptive thresholding without any hardcoded constants
7. **Changepoint detection** finds sustained transitions rather than isolated spikes
8. **Multi-episode detection** is essential for intermittent voiding (BPH, straining)
9. **ICS dual timing** (voiding vs flow time) is clinically important for accurate Qavg
